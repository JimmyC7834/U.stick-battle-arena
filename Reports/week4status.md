# Week 4 Report

## Team Report

1. Work on the architecture and design will happen next week where we will narrow down the features we want in the game. Additionally we will begin coding the basics of the game like the movement script and the simple scriptable objects. We will also continue to polish our living document.
2. In week 4, everyone just started their learning of Unity and C# since most of us did not know how to implement a game in Unity. Beyond that, we are also working on the team architecture and design document which provides a clear roadmap and plan for our implementation.
3. Next week, since we have finished our individual learning on Unity, we will start the real implementation of the first prototype (or at least a MVP) of the game. We will focus on the basic movement and weapons first, then we will dive into other features.

## Contributions

1. Everyone was tasked with doing a quick unity tutorial in the form of making a flappybird-like game. This is in preparation for the programming that will begin heavily on week 4.
