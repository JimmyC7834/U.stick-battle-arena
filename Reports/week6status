# Week 5 Report

## Team Report

1. Next week is going to be our content creation crunch.
2. In week 6, we refined the architecture and design portion to our living doc and refined weapon logic, and added weapon spwning feature. We are also starting many of the tasks on the Notion tasks board like content filling, menu UI, etc. We also setup CI and unit tests on our repo.
3. Next week, we will focus on filling missing features and content for our game like multiplayer input, more weapons and items. And also starting the visual asset creation from now on.
