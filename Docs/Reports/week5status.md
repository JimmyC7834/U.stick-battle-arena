# Week 4 Report

## Team Report

1. Next week is going to be our content creation crunch.
2. In week 5, we added the architecture and design portion to our living doc and created the basic player sripts.
3. Next week, we will create tests for our game, and we will get a working prototype working. Additionally, we will create basic assets and more advance scripts.

## Contributions

1. Since we have finished our individual learning on Unity, we will start the real implementation of the first prototype (or at least a MVP) of the game. We will focus on the basic movement and weapons first, then we will dive into other features.
