# Week 7 Report

## Team Report

1. In week 6, we refined the architecture and design portion to our living doc and refined weapon logic, and added weapon spwning feature. We are also starting many of the tasks on the Notion tasks board like content filling, menu UI, etc. We also setup CI and unit tests on our repo
2. In week 7 we got crunched for the beta release. Enough was done to get a good demo but we are bit behind where we planned to be.
3. Next week, we will be focusing on getting the last of our core elements into the game, and then implementing more in game content.
