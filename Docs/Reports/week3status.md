This is our first status report so we dont have anything to put here.

Everyone was tasked with doing a quick unity tutorial in the form of making a flappybird-like game. This is in preparation for the programming that will begin heavily
on week 4.

Work on the architecture and design will happen next week where we will narrow down the features we want in the game. Additionally we will begin coding the basics of the
game like the movement script and the simple scriptable objects. We will also continue to polish our living document.
