### Version Control
Version control is done through `JimmyC7834/U.stick-battle-arena` repo on github.
Adding to the project is done in a standardized [pull request workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) and follow these rules:
- Create a branch for the content you wish to add
  - be sure your branch is descriptive for your changes along with your name so it is easier to submit bug reports and ask for fixes. For example, `Jimmy-dev-Weapon-logic`, `Todd-patch-documentation`, etc.
- Commit often and with relevant messages/descriptions to make bug tracking easier
- Write tests for all new content you are adding
- Since the GameCI takes a while to run, before submitting a pull request for your branch make sure all tests pass locally (refer below for info on running tests)
- Do not approve pull requests that have not/ do not pass all tests in the GameCI (check actions tab)
- Do not approve pull requests that you have not fully reviewed and built locally
- Lastly, make sure all code follows the [C# style guide for Unity ](https://github.com/JimmyC7834/U.stick-battle-arena/blob/main/C%23%20style%20guide.md)
### Bug Tracking And Reporting
Bugs are reported to `JimmyC7834/U.stick-battle-arena` repo under the issues tab.
- It is best to let the responsible for the feature to fix the bug. Please `@` the responsibility for your issue. You can find the responsible by looking through the PR records or the branch with the responsible's name.
If a bug is found in a branch you are attempting to PR, the PR will not be approved until a suitable fix is implemented.
### Testing And GameCI
The project utilizes gameCI, which integrates with github under github actions. Everytime a PR is submitted all build tests and Test Runner tests are ran and the result will appear on the pull request page. Additionally, all submitted PR's will have their test results listed in the actions tab of the repo.
### Running in Unity editor for development
In order to run the system within the editor follow these steps:
- Download and install Unity
- Clone `JimmyC7834/U.stick-battle-arena` via ssh into desired project location
- Under the projects tab select 'Open'
- Select `U.stick-battle-arena` folder
- Ensure editor version is `2021.3.16f1`
- Once project is opened select the 'Play' button at the top of the screen
### Running the tests
The tests are handled by Unity TestRunner and can be launched through github actions or in Unity itself by following steps:
- From Github:
  - Github actions runs with every PR of the project and you can view the tests results in the actions tab of github
  - To rerun tests on a commit you can go to repo `JimmyC7834/U.stick-battle-arena` > actions > GameCI and click any PR then select 'Re-Run all jobs'
  - The test will then take 10-20 minutes to run and will make sure the game scuccessfully builds for Windows and the Unity web plugin. It will also run all unit tests     controlled by the Unity TestRunner
- From Unity:
  - Note: The Unit tests that can be ran from Unity are the same that are ran automatically in github actions upon a PR
  - Download and install Unity and open the project repo folder as a project using editor version `2021.3.16f1`
  - Once in the editor, at the top click Window > General > Test Runner 
  - A small window will appear with a list of tests
  - To run a particular test you can double click it in the list
  - To run all tests select 'Run All' in the top left of the Test Runner window
### Adding tests
- Have the project set to desired branch and open on Unity editor.
- Select Window > General > Test Runner to run and view tests.
- Add new test scripts or tests to existing scripts in the tests folder
- Whene adding tests, editor mode is for tests that will run within the editor and play mode tests are tests that run only during game runtime.
### Building the project
  - make sure you open th project in Unity version `2021.3.16f1`
  - Checkout and pull the `main` branch 
  - In Unity editor, click File > Build and Run to build and run the project
  - Alternatively, click File > Build Settings open up a window allowing simply building the project
### Building and release the project
  - discuss with the project member to confirm on the new/update release
  - follow the steps from section `Building the project` above to obtain the build folder
  - compress the build folder in to compressed file
  - upload the compressed build to the game release page:
    - [itch.io](https://jimmyc.itch.io/cse403-stick-battle-arena-alpha-release)
### Our goal
Our goal is to ship a finished game with refined details and fun gameplay by the end of the quarter. Also, to gain group project and teamwork experience along the development process.
### Use Cases
- [x] Player eliminates another player and is rewarded
 - We have a basic implementation so far where a playerâ€™s score is updated upon elimination
- [x] Player uses the abilities (weapons)
 - We have a variety of weapons currently in which each has its own unique characteristics. The player can successfully pick up weapons and deal damage to opposing players using the acquired abilities
- [x] Player Navigates the main menu
 - We have successfully implemented a menu system in which we can start and quit the game with plans to add and options menu in the final release
- [x] Player starts a local match
 - Players are successfully spawned into the game where they can actively acquire weapons spawned in and compete against each other
- [ ] Player pauses in the middle of the game
 - The pause menu we want to implement is still a work in progress to be added as a part of the final release
- [x] Player moves on the map
 - Players can successfully move with the arrow keys on the keyboard with plans to add custom keybinding for the final release.
